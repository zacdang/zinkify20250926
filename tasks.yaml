  description: 'Analyze the user question: "{user_question}" to classify any workplace
    issues into the three main domains. 1) Cross-functional alignment difficulties,
    2) Soft skills gaps, and 3) Company policy issues.'
  expected_output: "A structured case-specific classification report with exactly
    3 sections in JSON format:\n\n## Cross-functional alignment difficulties\n[One
    specific problem identified in this domain, or \"None identified\" if no issues
    found]\n\n## Soft skills gaps  \n[One specific problem identified in this domain,

    - Core objectives and KPIs
    - Primary data sources and metrics they rely on
    - Decision-making frameworks they use
    - Operational constraints and pressures
    - Communication styles and preferences
